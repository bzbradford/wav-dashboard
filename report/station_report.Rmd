# About the program

For over 25 years, the Water Action Volunteers program (WAV) has provided free training and equipment for volunteer stream monitors and nearly 50 partner groups (local coordinators) across Wisconsin who are interested in monitoring the water quality of wadeable streams and rivers in their local watershed. The WAV program provides volunteer training and support for baseline water quality monitoring, nutrient monitoring, continuous temperature monitoring, stream habitat assessments, and aquatic invasive species (AIS) monitoring.

The WAV program is supported by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Division of Extension. Some of the funding originates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to support Clean Water Act activities. WAV also receives a small percentage of program funds through private donations through the University of Wisconsin Foundation. Many WAV partners also independently fund and provide resources for volunteer stream monitoring while following WAV stream monitoring protocols.

**Contact WAV staff or your local coordinator:**

* *Web:* [www.wateractionvolunteers.org/about/contact-us/](https://wateractionvolunteers.org/about/contact-us/)
* *Email:* [wav@extension.wisc.edu](mailto:wav@extension.wisc.edu)

## How the data is collected

All data collected by WAV stream monitoring volunteers are entered by the volunteers into SWIMS, the Wisconsin DNR’s surface water database. Data for most variables are collected once per month from May through October, approximately 30 days apart. WAV volunteers follow the same protocols and use the same tools to collect water quality data to provide consistency across the state:

* *Temperature:* Glass thermometer or digital meter
* *Dissolved oxygen:* Hach Company DO titration kit or digital meter
* *Water transparency:* 120 centimeter turbidity tube
* *Streamflow:* Tennis ball float method, Flo-Mate meter, or U.S. Geological Survey stream gauge
* *Total phosphorus:* Water samples collected and shipped to an approved lab for analysis
* *Continuous temperature:* HOBO data logger

Volunteers may also collect pH and specific conductance measurements, but there is not a standard WAV protocol for doing so. If these measurements were taken and submitted to SWIMS, they are included in this report. Volunteers may also collect aquatic invasive species (AIS) counts, make biotic index assessments, or perform habitat assessments. These data are not currently included in the WAV online dashboard or in this report.

## Watersheds and other terms

A *watershed* is an area of land that channels rainfall, snowmelt, and runoff into a common body of water. The term "watershed" is often used interchangeably with "drainage basin," which may make the concept easier to visualize. A watershed can encompass a small area of land that drains into a trickling creek. It can encompass multiple states in the Midwest, all draining into the Mississippi River. Or it can encompass multiple countries draining into the Atlantic Ocean. No matter where you are standing or sitting right now, you are in a watershed.

Nationally, watersheds are defined by the US Geological Survey in the National Hydrography Dataset. These boundaries encompass successively smaller areas called _hydrological units_ and are given a numerical designation called a _hydrological unit code_ (HUC). These HUCs have a specific number of digits for each level of division. For example, Wisconsin is divided into 52 sub-basins (8 digit HUC), 372 watersheds (10 digit HUC), and 1,808 sub-watersheds (12 digit HUC). Some of these watershed boundaries extend across state lines. Any water falling into a watershed will ultimately collect into the same water body before flowing downstream into another waterbody, unless the basin has no outflow (e.g. Utah's Great Salt Lake). In Wisconsin, the DNR has its own naming and numbering system for watersheds (roughly equivalent to HUC10 scale from the USGS), which is included in the *Station Information* section. Use these names and codes to look up watershed information on the DNR's website.

# Understanding this report

For each type of fieldwork data, we have provided some summary statistics and explanatory text below each figure to help guide the interpretation of the results. In cases where the results may be compared against an established set of standards (e.g. temperature, streamflow, total phosphorus), the report generates a brief interpretation of the data based on the Wisconsin DNR's  _[Wisconsin Consolidated Assessment and Listing Methodology (WisCALM)](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/SurfaceWater/WisCALM.html)_ document. WisCALM is updated every two years and provides guidance on the assessment of water quality data against surface water quality standards and for Clean Water Act reporting on surface water quality status.

## Basic summary statistics

In this report, we provide several basic summary statistics to help interpret the data collected about the stream:

* *N:* The number of observations or samples collected.
* *Min/Max:* The minimum and maximum values for the year.
* *Mean:* The average value for the year (the mean is the sum of values divided by the number of values).
* *Median:* The middle value of a set of observations, or the mean of the two middle observations if there is an even number of values. It is less likely to be influenced by outliers compared to the mean.
* *Standard deviation (SD):* The spread of values (a large SD means there is a lot of variation in the data). The SD represents the average difference of each observation from the mean so it must be interpreted in relation to the size of the mean. Looking at the CV (defined below) helps make that comparison.
* *Coefficient of variation (CV):* Shows how big the standard deviation is relative to the mean and is another way to look at the consistency or spread of the data (a CV less than 100% means the standard deviation is smaller than the mean, and a CV greater than 100% means the standard deviation is larger than the mean). Calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean.
* *Confidence interval (CI):* A confidence interval (the 80% confidence interval in the case of total phosphorus monitoring) represents a range such that we are 80% confident (or some other confidence, such as 90%) that the true mean value that we are measuring lies between the upper and lower boundaries of that range. When making repeated observations, natural variation will result in different observations. More observations, or a lower level of natural variation, will result in tighter confidence intervals around a mean.

## Automatic data interpretations

Some of the pages in this report include a brief interpretation of the data, which is based on the specific criteria outlined below. Always be sure to inspect the data with a critical eye and keep in mind that there may be data entry errors that can result in invalid data being included in this report. It is also important to review several years of data from a stream to develop a better understanding of the stream's health and *Natural Community* classification. The DNR defines Natural Communities as assemblages of specific plant and animal species within a specific habitat, and a waterbody's Natural Community classification affects the kinds of assessments and standards applied to the waterbody.

* **Water temperature:** Both water temperature and streamflow need to be reviewed together to assign a Natural Community classification to a stream. For water temperature, the DNR uses four categories: *Coldwater* streams have maximum daily average temperatures below 69.3°F (20.7°C), *cool-cold* streams between 69.3°F and 72.5°F (22.5°C), *cool-warm* streams between 72.5°F and 76.3°F (24.6°C), and *warmwater* streams have maximum daily average temperatures above 76.3°F.

* **Dissolved oxygen:** *Coldwater* and *cool-cold* fish communities require a minimum of 7 mg/L from spawning to the emergence of the young (fall-spring), and 6 mg/L during other times of year. *Warmwater* and *cool-warm* communities require a minimum of 5 mg/L. Few fish can survive when DO drops to 3 mg/L, and virtually no aquatic life can survive DO levels of 1 mg/L or less.

* **pH:** The optimal pH for fish is around 7.5. The DNR's water quality standard sets a minimum (most acidic) pH of 6.0 and a maximum (most basic) pH of 9.0.

* **Specific conductance:** The aquatic life threshold in Wisconsin for chronic chloride exposure is a maximum of 395 mg/L, while the acute threshold is 795 mg/L, but specific conductance does not only measure the amount of chloride dissolved in water. Other dissolved minerals and ions contribute to water conductivity, so specific conductance thresholds are approximate. Specific conductance readings over 800 µS/cm are typically considered high and these levels are potentially detrimental to aquatic life. Specific conductance readings in the 1500-2000 µS/cm range are likely from high chloride levels and are approaching the State of Wisconsin’s 395 mg/L chloride toxicity threshold for aquatic life.

* **Streamflow:** Ephemeral streams are defined as having minimum flows of <0.03 cfs, headwater streams between 0.03 and 3 cfs, mainstem streams between 3 and 150 cfs, and large rivers greater than 150 cfs. Technically these cutoffs are for the 90% exceedance flow (90% of flow is greater than this value), but most volunteers collect less than 10 streamflow measurements per year so the minimum recorded streamflow is used in this report to determine streamflow classification.

* **Total phosphorus:** The DNR established a phosphorus exceedance criteria of 0.075 mg/L (ppm) for streams. For a stream to be listed as impaired, at least 6 monthly samples must be collected in each of two different years, and the entire 80% confidence interval for the median phosphorus value in each year must exceed the criteria. We use the following language for characterizing phosphorus levels: A stream ***clearly exceeds*** the phosphorus criteria and is likely impaired if the entire confidence interval exceeds the state standard. A stream site ***may exceed*** the phosphorus criteria if the median is higher than the standard but the lower confidence interval does not exceed the standard. A stream site ***may meet*** the phosphorus criteria if the median is below than the standard, but the upper confidence interval remains above the standard. When the median and the entire confidence interval is below the phosphorus standard, the stream ***clearly meets*** the state phosphorus criteria.

## Making the most of this report

Here are a few important points to keep in mind as you explore this stream’s data:

*	**Look at multiple years of data:** A stream’s characteristics will vary from year to year, so volunteers are encouraged to look at 2-5 years of data when making inferences about stream health and water quality. Extreme weather years can also create unrepresentative conditions.

*	**Look at the story from May through October:** Ideally we should have data for every month from May to October, to see how the stream’s water quality and baseline characteristics fluctuate naturally through the season. However, volunteers may miss one or more months of data collection for various reasons.

*	**Consider how the variables interact:** Each page shares data for a different parameter, such as water temperature or streamflow. But these variables all interact with and influence one another.

*	**Remember this stream is part of a larger watershed:** Ultimately, the conditions in the stream or river are affected by land use and activities upstream in the watershed.

*	**Watch for outliers:** This report shares raw data reported by stream monitors that has undergone minimal cleaning. If you see any outliers (values far outside a typical range of values for the stream), consider the cause: Is there a logical reason for the outlier value based on other data collected that month? Was the data collected after a large storm event in non-baseline conditions? Unusual values may also be due to data entry errors such as missing a decimal point or adding an extra number. Unfortunately SWIMS does not do any data checking or validation when volunteers submit data. If you notice an error and you were the data submitter, you may be able to log on to SWIMS and correct the error.

  p("Water temperature, along with streamflow, has a strong impact on the biological community in a stream. Aquatic plant and animal species are adapted to different temperature ranges, so measuring baseline water temperature throughout the year can help characterize a stream’s Natural Community. Salmonids such as Wisconsin’s native brook trout require cold water temperatures to live and reproduce, while other fish species such as bass, darter and sucker species are adapted to live in warmwater streams. Coldwater streams generally have higher levels of dissolved oxygen which is beneficial to aquatic life. Many coldwater streams in Wisconsin receive most of their flow from groundwater, while other streams and rivers are fed by warmer surface waters. Warmer water temperatures can indicate a stream is a natural warmwater stream or river, or they can indicate shallow, pooled or stagnant water, or a once colder stream that has been impacted by human activity. This is why it is important to look at water temperature and streamflow together when characterizing a stream's Natural Community.

  p("Temperature is often referred to as a 'master variable' in aquatic ecosystems because temperature determines the speed of important processes, from basic chemical reactions to the growth and metabolism of fishes and other organisms. In addition, temperature determines the type of fish community that the stream can support. It is especially important to gather stream temperature information over many years in order to track how quickly our streams are warming due to climate change. The continuous data loggers you have deployed and maintained are a 21st-century approach to monitoring stream temperature, providing accurate, high-resolution temperature data as we monitor the health of streams across the state.")
  p("Anomalous temperature readings at the very beginning and end of the data may reflect air temperatures before the logger was deployed into the stream.

  p("Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a gas found in water that is critical for sustaining aquatic life (just as atmospheric oxygen is required for humans to survive). Oxygen dissolves into water when mixing with the air from wind, rapids, dams and waterfalls, and is produced by aquatic plants and algae in the stream during photosynthesis. Aquatic plants, fish, macroinvertebrates and bacteria use this dissolved oxygen as they respire. Most fish and many macroinvertebrates cannot survive in waters with DO levels below 4-5 mg/L for a sustained period of time. Macroinvertebrate species sensitive to dissolved oxygen, such as stoneflies, and coldwater fish species such as trout, require high levels of dissolved oxygen. DO percent saturation reflects the amount of oxygen currently dissolved in water relative to the equilibrium amount that water will hold at a given temperature and ambient air pressure. Values above 100% indicate the water is supersaturated with oxygen, which can be an indicator of excess plant or algae growth and other water quality issues if the values are too high. Values far below 100% can indicate excess plants, algae, sewage or organic matter in the stream and higher levels of decay of this organic matter.")

That means for every 1 pH change, there is a tenfold change in the activity of hydrogen ions. Waters with high hydrogen-ion activity have low pH and are considered acidic. The presence of dissolved carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions strongly influence the pH of freshwater systems. Wisconsin has adopted a pH standard that incorporates a range from 6 to 9 units to protect and support aquatic life.")
  p("Much of Wisconsin has bedrock that is composed of limestone and other rock that is rich in bicarbonate and carbonate. These types of rock can minimize impacts of acid rain or other acidic inputs to the water. In northern Wisconsin, bedrock is composed of granite which is not rich in bicarbonates and carbonates, and thus those rocks are less able to buffer or offset the impacts of acid rain or other acid inputs to the waters.")

  p("## Why measure conductivity?")
  p("In Wisconsin, specific conductance (conductivity) in streams varies widely across the state and even within a single watershed depending on the geology and soils in the area. Groundwater flowing into streams and minerals washed into streams from local soils can all affect a stream’s baseline conductivity. It’s important to recognize that specific conductance is not just an indicator of dissolved chloride ions, but it measures all dissolved ions, including calcium and bicarbonate. For example, in southern Wisconsin, the bedrock has high levels of calcium, which increases conductivity readings in streams in the region. As a result, there is a wide range for specific conductance readings in Wisconsin streams. Some streams may have a natural specific conductance under 100 µS/cm, while other streams may have a natural specific conductance of over 500 µS/cm. However, chloride ions from road salt washing into streams can significantly increase conductivity to dangerous levels for aquatic life. Specific conductance greater than 800 µS/cm is considered high, while readings of 1500-2000 µS/cm or greater are likely from high chloride levels and are approaching Wisconsin's 395 mg/L chloride toxicity threshold for aquatic life.")

  p("These measurements reflect the visual transparency, or clarity, of the water. The higher the transparency, the clearer the water. Transparency is easy to measure and is related to turbidity, which is commonly used to quantify the amount of suspended particles in the water, but requires specialized equipment to measure. All streams have a natural amount of background turbidity. Fish and macroinvertebrates have evolved over time to adapt to natural, short term changes in turbidity, but the longer a stream or river remains at unusually high turbidity levels, the greater effect it has on aquatic life. Extremely high levels of turbidity impair survival by blocking the membranes that aquatic life use to breathe, by interfering with filter-feeding animals, and by making it difficult for fish to find food. Turbid waters also hold more heat, increasing stream temperatures and reducing dissolved oxygen levels.")
  p("Low transparency indicates there are more suspended sediment or algae particles in the stream, perhaps from recent storm events stirring up silt within the stream, surface water runoff and soil erosion, or excess nutrients fueling algae growth. Transparency is also associated with the color of the water, as some waters are more “tea-stained” in appearance due to decomposition of organic matter. Acceptable maximum turbidity levels for aquatic life in streams are < 10 NTUs (Nephelometric Turbidity Units), which is comparable to a 54.7 cm transparency reading. There is no state criteria in Wisconsin for turbidity.")

Streamflow is affected by the amount of water within a watershed, increasing with rainstorms or snowmelt, and decreasing during dry periods. Streamflow is important because it defines the shape, size and course of the stream. It is integral not only to water quality, but also to habitat. Food sources, spawning areas and migration paths of fish and other wildlife are all affected and defined by streamflow and water velocity. Velocity and flow together determine the kinds of organisms that can live in the stream (some need fast-flowing areas; others need quiet, low-velocity pools).")
  p("Streamflow is affected by both forces of nature and by humans. Soil type, vegetation, and slope all play a role in how fast and how much water reaches a stream. In watersheds with high human impacts, water flow might be depleted by withdrawals for irrigation, domestic or industrial purposes. Dams used for electric power generation may affect flow, particularly during periods of peak need when streamflow is held back and later released in a surge. Drastically altering landscapes in a watershed, such as with development, can also change flow regimes, causing faster runoff with storm events and higher peak flows due to increased areas of impervious surface. These altered flows can negatively affect an entire ecosystem by upsetting habitats and organisms dependent on natural flow rates.")

This means that, given the TP concentrations measured this year, there is about an 80% chance that the true median total phosphorus concentration falls somewhere between those lines.")
