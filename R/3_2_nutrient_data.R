Small increases in phosphorus levels can bring about substantial increases in aquatic plant and algae growth, which in turn can reduce the recreational use and biodiversity. When the excess plants die and are decomposed, oxygen levels in the water drop dramatically which can lead to fish kills. Additionally, one of the most common impairments in Wisconsinâ€™s streams is excess sediment that covers stream bottoms. Since phosphorus moves attached to sediments, it is intimately connected with this source of pollution in our streams. Phosphorus originates naturally from rocks, but its major sources in streams and lakes today are usually associated with human activities: soil erosion, human and animal wastes, septic systems, and runoff from farmland or lawns. Phosphorus-containing contaminants from urban streets and parking lots such as food waste, detergents, and paper products are also potential sources of phosphorus pollution from the surrounding landscape. The impact that phosphorus can have in streams is less apparent than in lakes due to the overall movement of water, but in areas with low velocity, where sediment can settle and deposit along the bottom substrate, algae blooms can result."),

The monthly water samples were collected approximately 30 days apart and no samples were collected within 15 days of one another."),
