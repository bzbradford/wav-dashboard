  **Temperature:** The chart shows both the recorded air temperature and water temperature. Cold streams generally provide better habitat because they can contain higher levels of dissolved oxygen, and higher water temperatures may indicate shallow, pooled, or stagnant water. These values were recorded during baseline fieldwork events; if there was a water temperature data logger deployed, those measurements appear later in this report.

**Dissolved Oxygen:** The amount of dissolved oxygen (D.O.) in a stream is critical for aquatic life, particularly larger animals like fish. 5 mg/L is considered the minimum level for fish, while 7 mg/L is the minimum required by trout in the spawning season. Colder waters can support higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen than warmer waters. The percent saturation refers to the equilibrium amount of oxygen that can dissolve into the water from the atmosphere. Higher than 100% D.O. saturation means oxygen is being actively added to the water, either by aquatic life or by air-water mixing. Lower than 100% D.O. saturation means the dissolved oxygen has been depleted below equilibrium level by plant or algal respiration or decomposition.

  **Transparency:** These measurements reflect the turbidity, or clarity, of the stream water.

Lower transparency isn't necessarily bad but can be associated with warm waters with low dissolved oxygen and lots of suspended algae.

The shaded horizontal band on the plot represents the 90% confidence interval for the median total phosphorus (TP) at this site (if more than one month of data was collected). This means that, given the TP concentrations measured this year, there is about an 90% chance that the true median total phosphorus concentration falls somewhere between those lines. We know that TP in streams varies quite a bit, so individual samples could be higher or lower than the confidence interval.

**Exceedance criteria:** A stream site ***clearly exceeds*** the phosphorus limit and the confidence interval band will be shaded **red** if the lower 90% confidence limit of the sample median exceeds the state total phosphorus limit of **0.075 mg/L**. A stream site ***may exceed*** the phosphorus limit if the median is higher than the phosphorus limit, but the lower confidence interval is below the limit. A stream site ***may meet*** the phosphorus criteria if the median is lower than the phosphorus limit, but the upper confidence interval remains above the limit. When the entire confidence interval is below the phosphorus limit, the site ***clearly meets*** the phosphorus limit, and the shaded confidence interval band in the plot above will be colored **teal**.

  **What does water temperature tell us?** Temperature is often referred to as a 'master variable' in aquatic ecosystems because temperature determines the speed of important processes, from basic chemical reactions to the growth and metabolism of fishes and other organisms. In addition, temperature determines the type of fish community that the stream can support.
  
  It is especially important to gather stream temperature information over many years in order to track how quickly our streams are warming due to climate change. The continuous data loggers you have deployed and maintained are a 21st-century approach to monitoring stream temperature, providing accurate, high-resolution temperature data as we monitor the health of streams across the state.
  
  Anomalous temperature readings at the very beginning and end of the data may reflect air temperatures before the logger was deployed into the stream. It's also possible that the logger because exposed to the air during deployment if water levels dropped. Depending on the depth and location of the logger, there may be sections of the stream that are consistently warmer or colder than the logger recorded.
  
  On the chart above, the cutoffs for a stream's temperature classification are shown as shaded areas. ***Coldwater*** streams have typical maximum summer temperatures below 22.2°C (72°F). ***Coolwater*** streams have maximum summer temperatures between 22.2°C and 25°C (77°F). ***Warmwater*** streams have maximum summer temperatures above 25°C.
